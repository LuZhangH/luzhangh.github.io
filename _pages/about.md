I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics at Harvard](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Prof. Lucas Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu). I also work with [Prof. Junwei Lu](https://junwei-lu.github.io) from the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/). I am particularly interested in solving problems related to high dimensional inference, combinatorial inference, multiple testing, graphical models and reinforcement learning. My research finds main applications in genetics and computational neuroscience.

Prior to Harvard, I obtained a B.S. in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017, with my undergraduate thesis advised by [Prof. Zemin Zheng](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/Profile-302.html).
